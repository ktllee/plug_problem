\section{Plugs}

Our mathematical model for a plug is a bit string, for example
\plug{1011}. Our current convention is that there are no leading or
trailing \plug{0} bits. (We may want to relax that convention at some
time.)

The \emph{length} of a plug is the length of the string; this one has
length $4$. The \emph{number of prongs} is the number of \plug{1} bits
--- $3$ in this example.


Each plug has a \emph{plugnumber} when we
interpret its bit string as a binary integer. So \plug{1011} is
number $1 + 4 + 8 = 13$.%
\footnote{This convention reads increasing bit significance from left
  to right, so the first bit is the units bit. We can change our minds
  and set the plugnumber for \plug{1011} to $1+2+8 = 11$ if we wish,
  but let's decide soon and stick to our decision.}

Since plugs begin and end with \plug{1} bits,
the plugs of length $n$ have plugnumbers the odd integers between
$2^{n-1} +1$ and $2^n -1$.
\footnote{This equivalence will need revision if we allow leading and
  trailing \plug{0}s in plug bitstrings.}

We will want ways to talk about plugs other than specifying their bit
strings or plugnumbers. In any context we can give a plug any name we
like, or have variables whose values can be plugs.

The Stackexchange question that triggered our project asked about
the $2$ prong plugs. We will give
them their own names: $T_n$ for the two prong plug of length $n$, It
has $n-2$ \plug{0} bits between its $2$ end prongs.
\footnote{Perhaps we want the nontraditional $n_T$, emphasizing the
  $n$ in our name for the two prong plug of that length.}

That question used the the single prong plug number $1$ instead of the
double prong plug $T_2$ with no gap between its prongs.

\section{Plug Puzzles}

\begin{anote}
The discussion here pays a lot of attention to reusing plugs,
  and whether two instances of the same plug are the same or
  different. Our work so far seems to have focussed on allowing
  multiple instances of plugs and not distinguishing among them. So we
  should probably design vocabulary that makes that easiest. If so,
  this section needs a rewrite.
\end{anote}

A \emph{plug puzzle} is a finite multiset\footnote{A multiset is a
  ``set that allows for repetitions of elements''.}
 of plugs. A \emph{labeled} plug puzzle is a set of labeled
 plugs. The fact that it's a set implies that all the labels are
 distinct. When no two of the plugs have the same shape (bit string)
 the strings or the plug numbers can serve as labels.

 The distinction between ordinary and labeled plug sets is analogous
 to the distinction common in combinatorial counting questions where
 the balls being distributed into boxes are identical or
 distinguishable.

 In Python we would model a labeled plug puzzle as a dictionary, with
 key the label and value the plug.

 For example, consider the labeled puzzle
 \begin{equation*}
   \{ (a, \plug{1011}),
   (b,\plug{1001}),
   (c, \plug{1001}),
   (d, \plug{101}) \}
\end{equation*}

 The \emph{length} of a plug puzzle is the sum of the lengths of its
 plugs. This puzzle has length $9$.
 
 \section{Power strip}

 \begin{anote}
Not sure whether to think of a power strip as a place to plug
 in plugs or as a strip with some plugs in place. For now, the latter
 seems to require fewer words.
\end{anote}

 
 A \emph{power strip} (or just a \emph{strip}) models a place to plug
 in plugs. Think of it as a finite sequence of slots some of
 which are occupied by the prongs of plugs. So a power strip
is a pair consisting of an array of slots and a set of (plug, offset)
pairs such that all the plugs can be inserted simultaneously at
 the specified offsets. It is a \emph{solved} if
 every slot in the strip is filled.

 \section{An easy interesting question}

 The stackexchange question asked for a fast algorithm to count the
 number of solutions for the plug puzzles consisting of one each of
 the first $n$ two prong puzzles.
 
We think that problem is too  hard to tackle first. We may return to
it.  Here's the natural first one to start with, Given an empty strip
of length $n$, find all the plug puzzle solutions, allowing multiples
of any kinds of plugs. We'll call that problem $\mathbb{E}$, for easy.
The answer is hardly worth calling a
theorem, but it begins to put us in touch with some classical notions
in combinatorics.

\begin{theorem} For each integer $n$, solved strips for the plug
  puzzles that allow arbitrary many instances of any plug
correspond to the partitions of the   $n$-element set $[n] = \{1,2,
\ldots, n \}$. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{anote}
Example here --- wait until the good \LaTeX{} plug representation
  is done.
\end{anote}

The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_number}{Bell numbers}
$\{1, 2, 3, 5, 15, 52, \ldots$  count these.

\section{Thickness, factoring}

There is more information in a a solved power strip than the shape of
the partition that defines it. For example, two copies of \plug{101}
solve a strip of length $4$. So do two copies of \plug{11}. All of
those plugs correspond to a partition the four element set of slots
into two sets of two slots each. But their geometry is different.

In a  power strip of length $n$ there are $n-1$ \emph{gaps} between
slots. The \emph{thickness} or \emph{thickness array} is a the
sequence of integers that counts the number of plugs that cover each
of the gaps. A solution (that is, a filled strip) is \emph{prime} if
its thickness is never $0$. Any solution is a concatenation of prime
filled strips: the \emph{factors}.

Whether or not the factors are themselves solutions to a
particular problem depends on the problem specifications. For the
stackexchange problem nontrivial factors are never solutions since
solutions must use all the two prong plugs up to some length. For the
most general problem discussed in the preceding section every prime
factor is a solution for its shorter strip. When that  happens we can
relate the number of prime solutions and the number of solutions.

Let $b_n$ be the number of solved strips of length $n$ and
$p_n$ the number of prime solutions of length $n$.

Some of the counts $b_n$ and $p_n$ may be $0$. Consider the
problem that uses just the classic two prong plug \plug{11}.
Then $b_n = 1$ if $n$ is even, $0$ if $n$ is odd. $p_2 =1$ and
$p_n = 0$ when $n \ne 2$.

The sequence $\{1,1,2,6,22, \ldots\}$ counts the prime solutions to
problem $\mathbb{E}$. That sequence seems to be
\href{https://oeis.org/A074664}{A074664} in
\href{https://oeis.org}{The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer
  Sequences}. The comments there about permutations and partitions
strongly supports

\begin{conjecture}
The prime solutions to problem $\mathbb{E}$ are characterized by the
equivalent conditions defining the OEIS sequence A074664.
\end{conjecture}

This easy theorem might help prove the conjecture:

\begin{theorem}
Suppose that every factor of a solved strip solves its smaller strip.
 Then
$$
b_n = p_1 b_{n-1} + p_2b_{n-2} + \cdots + p_{n-1}b_1 + p_n
$$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Each solved strip begins with a prime solution of length $k \le n$ which can be
chosen $p_k$ ways and ends with one of the $b_{n-k}$ solved strips of
length $n-k$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{anote}
So far we've used thickness only to find factors. But there is
probably more information to exploit. What's the maximum thickness?
What patterns are possible in the thickness vector?
