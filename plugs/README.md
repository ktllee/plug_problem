For non-Cuisenaire plugs (or at least not-necessarily-Cuisenaire plugs).

## Scripts

`flex_solver.py` is code to recursively solve for valid arrangements given types of plugs and a total length, as well as an optional plug count.  **Likely functional.  In Progress.**

`count_solver.py` is code to recursively solve for valid arrangements given types of plugs and a total number of plugs.  **In Progress.**

`overview_solver.py` is code to quickly show a table of the number of total and prime solutions given a dictionary of plugs. **Functional.**

`plug_class.py` contains the Plug class.  **Functional.**

`strip_class.py` contains the Strip class. **Functional.**
