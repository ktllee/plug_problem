# Unused code

Scripts that are not up to date and/or have been superseeded by other "active" functions.

## Inactive scripts

`ethan-plugclass.py` - a preliminary class for Plugs

`original_plugs.py` - code to brute-force solutions with all distinct plugs (no repeats), where plugs are defined by number of prongs and gaps between prongs (and all gaps are equal).

## Lost features

Features in inactive code that are not available in currently active code.

+ Functions to acquire attributes from a Plug object (`ethan-plugclass.py`).

+ Functions to generate lists of plugs to put into the solver(s).
